## Usage

There are a few ways to run the project.

### Without Docker

- Install Node.js and pnpm on your machine if you haven't already.
- Use `./generate-secrets.sh` to generate passwords for your environment variables. Only use JWT_SECRET and MASTER_SIGNUP_KEY and manually set them in the server's `.env` file. Check the `.env` file for other required environment variables.
- Use `pnpm install` to install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend.
- Start the backend server with `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm start` for production) in the server directory
- Start the frontend development server with `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm build` -> `pnpm preview` for simulated production) in the client directory.

### With Docker Compose

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if you haven't already.
- Use `./generate-secrets.sh` to generate passwords for your environment variables. Check the `.env` file for other required environment variables.
- Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` to start the development server or `docker compose up -d` instead for the production server.

### Only a database

- Use the `diocker-compose.db.yml` file to only start the database.

## Changelog

### Project Sprint 1

### Project Sprint 2

- I decided to use Vue.js for the frontend. Then I built the home page with HTML/CSS and mock posts.

### Project Sprint 3a

- I noticed that I need a backend for the project, so I decided to use Express.js for the backend.
- I built a REST API with Express.js and PostgreSQL for the backend. AI helped me a lot with that. I also used AI to build the frontend for the database (for now). I'll redo the frontend later myself.
